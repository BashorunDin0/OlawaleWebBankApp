This is a repository for a web bank app, simulating a typical Nigeria banking system, that lets you do the following;
Cash deposits,
Cash withdrawals,
Cash transfers,
Generates a 10 digits random account number,
Sends email alert,
Generates bank statement of transactions,
Persisted to an H2 in-memory database.
I will be securing the bank app with Spring security (Authentication & Authorization) feature in subsequent updates
